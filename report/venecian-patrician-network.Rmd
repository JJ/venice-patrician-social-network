abstract:
  The Venetian republic was one of the most successful transmodern states, surviving for a millenium through innovation, commercial cunning, exploitation of colonies and legal stability. Part of the success might be due to its government structure, a republic ruled by a doge chosen among a set of Venetian patrician families. In this paper we analyze the structure of the social network they formed through marriage, and how government was monopolyzed by a relatively small set of families, the one that became patrician first.
