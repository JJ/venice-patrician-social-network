abstract = {This article outlines the commercial and financial activities of commercial networks active in the ‘Venetian’ eastern Mediterranean between the loss of Cyprus (1571) and the onset of the War of Candia (1645). The goal of the article is to present the results of recent research on early modern Mediterranean trade and finance, drawing attention to some promising areas of investigation that have been overlooked by scholarship and that constitute part of the author's own work in progress. The central question is: how did traditional Mediterranean networks and trade fare in the age of global expansion? In other words, did Mediterranean trade networks experience an evolution in their structures similar to the rest of the world? An attempt is made to answer this question through an analysis of the activities of Greek, Venetian, and English mercantile and financial networks in the eastern Mediterranean, showing the peculiarities of the interplay between trade and finance that underpinned the economy of the Venetian Stato da Mar. This attempt highlights two phenomena at play within the ‘Venetian Mediterranean’: firstly, that foreign operators began directly financing Venetian imperial administrative structures, and secondly, that the number of Venetian merchants involved in these operations increased as new players entered the financial game.},

abstract="Between the fifth and the thirteenth century ad, from the fall of Rome to the stirrings of the Renaissance, the politics of Europe was monarchical and hierarchical, feudal, brutal and unfair. Throughout this exact period, Venice played a role in keeping democratic tendencies alive. Venice flourished in the so-called `Dark Ages', economically and intellectually, with a system of government that often fell into oligarchy and sometimes toyed with autocracy, but which nevertheless kept the best traditions of Greek and Roman democratic citizenship alive. The most serene republic---Serenissima, as Venice styled itself---had many democratic virtues: it was founded in equality and frank speech, at play in the liminal and willing to adapt collectively to defend itself and prosper. Venice owes its existence to its location on a large lagoon formed by the estuaries of many rivers to the west and by the long, thin sand islands thrown up by the currents of the Adriatic Sea to the east. Because of its location, Venice could avoid the worst of the barbarian invasions and the wars between empires to keep alive its own republican, and even democratic traditions.",

ABSTRACT = {During most of the lifespan of the Venetian republic, doges (the name their presidents received) were elected for life. However, a long tenure was a rare event, which effectively resulted in term limits, as has already been reported by several authors. In this paper, we examine the length of these tenures and their evolution during the existence of the Venetian republic, following Smith et al.&rsquo;s claim that specific events in Venetian history caused this shortening, but also the dates and possibly event or events that effectively caused that limitation by design. Finally, we will discuss the causes of this limitation and its effective consequences.},

If the required super-majority is chosen appropriately, the rule yields a unique winner and voting cycles cannot occur. The voting procedure for electing a Doge in medieval Venice, developed in 1268, employed a super-majority requirement agreeing with the Caplin and Nalebuff formula. We present a brief history of the Venetian political institutions, show how the rule was employed, and argue that it contributed to the remarkable centuries-long political stability of Venice.},

To do so, we propose a new set of functions, affinities, designed to capture the nature of the local interactions among each pair of actors in a network. By using these functions, we develop a new community detection algorithm, the Borgia Clustering, where communities naturally arise from the multi-agent interaction in the network. We also discuss the effects of size and scale for communities regarding this case, as well as how we cope with the additional complexity present when big communities arise. Finally, we compare our community detection solution with other representative algorithms, finding favourable results.}

Born in ca. 1107, Dandolo was the product of a proud but relatively new Venetian family that had devoted itself to commerce and service to the state. In his early years, Enrico lived through the enthusiasm of the Venetian crusade of 1122. Like his fellow countrymen, he was proud of the Republic's great effort, and especially of the participation of his father, uncle, and grandfather in the holy enterprise. Throughout his career, Enrico Dandolo was probably away from Venice more than not. But his expertise in foreign lands coupled with his increasingly trusted family name, made Dandolo an important player in Venetian politics after the assassination of Doge Vitale Michiel in 1172. From Byzantium to Alexandria to Ferrara, Enrico Dandolo traveled representing his state. His election in 1192 at the age of eighty-five is not, therefore, surprising. His family had worked its way into the highest offices and helped shape the new Venetian constitution. For his part, Enrico had performed service after service for the Republic, many with considerable success. Dandolo's reign was revolutionary, but more for its foreign rather than domestic initiatives. A group of favorable treaties put Venetian merchants in much safer positions in Italian markets. Dandolo also succeeded in fending off Pisan aggression in the Adriatic, brought Brindisi under control, and, with the help of the Fourth Crusade, crushed the rebellious Zara. No action in his reign, however, can compare with the conquest of Constantinople which transformed Venice into a commercial empire. On the domestic side Dandolo's policies were less spectacular. While he did issue two new coins, these were made necessary by the monumental changes thrust on Venice by the Fourth Crusade. They were not enlightened modifications in Venetian fiscal policy. By the same token, Dandolo's "legal reform" was probably just barely legal, and not a reform. If he had a hand in it at all, his contribution to Venetian constitutional development was limited to collecting seventy-four customs for his own and his successors' reference. Nicetas Choniates was wrong in his harsh assessment of Dandolo: a man he never met. Dandolo harbored no smoldering hatred for Constantinople and her people. The still popular arguments for Dandolo's vengeful motivations in the conquest of Byzantium have no basis other than the street gossip of an embittered Nicetas and an ignorant Chronicle of Novgorod. They should once and for all be dispensed with.},

abstract={The Republic of Venice has rightly been considered a prime example of the fusion between political institutions and trade. Frederic Lane aptly defined the Venetian Senate, Venice's most important political-institutional body, as the Republic's "board of governors". The great historian meant to stress that the state institutions in certain aspects embodied the interests of the ruling class, which for the most part consisted of merchants -- at least until the end of the fifteenth century -- and also that these interests had shaped the Republic's system of government. Formal and informal structures were the underlying factors in Venetian success. Unlike Genoa, in medieval Venice the clan structure gradually became weaker, and, at the same time, the ruling class managed to create a system of regulations that prevented the formation of a dominant group and encouraged collaboration between family groups and the various factions. It has been rightly stated that Venice is a distinctive case as far as the role of government in trade is concerned.},

    abstract = "{International trade can have profound effects on domestic institutions. We examine this proposition in the context of medieval Venice circa 800–1600. Early on, the growth of long-distance trade enriched a broad group of merchants who used their newfound economic muscle to push for constraints on the executive, that is, for the end of a de facto hereditary Doge in 1032 and the establishment of a parliament in 1172. The merchants also pushed for remarkably modern innovations in contracting institutions that facilitated long-distance trade, for example, the colleganza. However, starting in 1297, a small group of particularly wealthy merchants blocked political and economic competition: they made parliamentary participation hereditary and erected barriers to participation in the most lucrative aspects of long-distance trade. Over the next two centuries this led to a fundamental societal shift away from political openness, economic competition, and social mobility and toward political closure, extreme inequality, and social stratification. We document this oligarchization using a unique database on the names of 8,178 parliamentarians and their families’ use of the colleganza in the periods immediately before and after 1297. We then link these families to 6,959 marriages during 1400–1599 to document the use of marriage alliances to monopolize the galley trade. Monopolization led to the rise of extreme inequality, with those who were powerful before 1297 emerging as the undisputed winners.}",

 abstract = {We analyze the centralization of political parties and elite networks that underlay the birth of the Renaissance state in Florence. Class revolt and fisical crisis were the ultimate causes of elite consolidation, but Medicean political control was produced by means of network disjunctures within the elite, which the Medici alone spanned. Cosimo de' Medici's multivocal identity as sphinx harnessed the power available in these network holes and resolved the contradiction between judge and boss inherent in all organizations. Methodologically, we argue that to understand state formation one must penetrate beneath the veneer of formal institutions, groups, and goals down to the relational substrata of peoples' actual lives. Ambiguity and heterogeneity, not planning and self- interest, are the raw materials of which powerful states and persons are constructed.},
